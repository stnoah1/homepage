**Abstract**

The rapidly emerging Augmented Reality (AR) devices, especially head mounted displays (HMD), show great potential to enhance human capabilities. Yet the most of the HMD rely on on hand held input controllers for interactions. On the other hand, the advancing wearable technologies enlighten new opportunities to develop comfortable input devices for AR. Our motivation is to design and develop a lightweight, unobtrusive interactive device that is easy to fabricate, and suitable for interactions in many environments. We introduce ControllAR, a parametrically sized glove, which offers a comfortable and low profile design that eases the interactions with AR head mounted devices. ControllAR provides a parametrizing interface, simple and accessible fabrication workflow with no soldering or sewing involved, and a pressure sensor using a soft piezoresistive elastomer material. Through a series of experiments and use cases, we confirm that ControllAR achieves an accuracy of 82.4 for a uniform speed of navigation between users, notably comfortable, and hands-free interaction with its personalized fit while using Augmented Reality. Moreover, we obtain improvements in the settling tim
