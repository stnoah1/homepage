**Abstract**

In recent years, hand wearables have gained popularity in applications related to human-computer interaction (HCI). However, these wearables present serious concerns due to bulky form factors and complicated fabrication processes. These concerns limit usability and social acceptance of wearables. We present SleekPatch, a fabrication-workflow that enables the development of a self-contained and slim hand wearable that provides comfort, social acceptance, and mobility to facilitate interactions with mobile computing. We propose a new fabrication workflow for SleekPatch, by combining off-the-shelf textile and conductive inks to generate circuits, instead of complicated, tedious methods such as soldering, sewing, or stitching. We take measurements from the userâ€™s phalanges of the index finger and input them into a simple interface to reconfigure a predesigned template of SleekPatch and its sensory input locations. The workflow results in a printable and wearable template for fabrication using conductive ink and off-the-shelf materials. We evaluate technical parameters of fabrication, wearability, slim design, comfort, and applicability with user studies and use cases.
