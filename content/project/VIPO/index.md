**Abstract**

Programming and integration of robotic platforms and new technologies such as IoT Nodes are complicated to under- stand, develop, and to execute from a perspective of novice users. Robot programming requires deep understanding of several technical disciplines for development of software for planning autonomous mobile robot work flows. In this paper, we introduce VIPO, a web-based visual and spatial program- ming language that allows novice users and small industries to program mobile robots and IoT Nodes to execute planned tasks (locomotion and manipulation) in smart-industrial en- vironments. In addition to the visual programming language, we also present a system that dynamically register architec- ture that deploys VIPO for programming a ROS-based mobile robot and Arduino-based IoT Nodes for a simple industrial use case. Future evaluations will demonstrate the understanding, time reduction, capabilities that the programming language and interface provides when programming robotic and inte- grated systems. We discuss the advantages and implications of VIPO in future applications in smart environments.
