# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University and member of [C DESIGN LAB](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision and Robotics, focusing on 3D Geometric Deep Learning for recognizing and synthesizing 3D objects. In this area, I apply Machine/Deep Learning algorithms for Augmented/Virtual Reality and Smart Factory.
